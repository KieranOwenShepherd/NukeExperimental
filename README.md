# NukeNotes

The particular nuances of nuke
are difficult to call to mind
when moving from one studio to another
leaving developed code behind

With societies 'protections'
forcing ownership endowed
taking notes, surely this
is reasonably still allowed.

tldr: notes and snippets about how to do various things in nuke.
